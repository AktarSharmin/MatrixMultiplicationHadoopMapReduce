# MatrixMultiplicationHadoopMapReduce

This project aims to perform matrix-vector multiplication both in Single Node & pseudo-cluster modes. 
The input takes the form of : "<M> <row num> <col num> <element>" for the matrix and "<V> <row num> <col num> <element>" for the vector.
The matrix and Vector has a dimension of 1100 * 1100 & 1100 * 1 respectively. The matrix and the vector are read from the same file : input-sharmin.txt
